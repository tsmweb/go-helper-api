	// within an aggregate should use the id of the containing aggregate root, e.g. the purchase order id for an order
	// line cancelation event. This id will be used as the key for Kafka messages later on. That way, all events
	// pertaining to one aggregate root or any of its contained sub-entities will go into the same partition of that

	// AggregateType the type of the aggregate root to which a given event is related; the idea being, leaning on the
	// same concept of domain-driven design, that exported events should refer to an aggregate ("a cluster of domain
	// objects that can be treated as a single unit"), where the aggregate root provides the sole entry point for
	// accessing any of the entities within the aggregate. This could for instance be "purchase order" or "customer".
	//
	// This value will be used to route events to corresponding topics in Kafka, so thereâ€™d be a topic for all events
	// related to purchase orders, one topic for all customer-related events etc. Note that also events pertaining to a
	// child entity contained within one such aggregate should use that same type. So e.g. an event representing the
	// cancelation of an individual order line (which is part of the purchase order aggregate) should also use the type
	// of its aggregate root, "order", ensuring that also this event will go into the "order" Kafka topic.

	// Type the type of event, e.g. "Order Created" or "Order Line Canceled". Allows consumers to trigger suitable
	// event handlers.
